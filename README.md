# Sass boilerplate

I've created this repository to speed up my projects because the initial configuration takes some precious minutes.

How to use: the best way for me is to ```git pull``` this into a folder called /scss/ on the project's root folder.

I use Sass on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) alongside the [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass).

Godspeed!
