### What I learned

Due to some differences between React and vanilla JavaScript, this was the hardest Frontend Mentor challenge I've ever solved. The [useful resources](#useful-resources) were indispensable.

Despite the difficulty and time spent, this challenge was really important for me to develop crucial React development skills. Thankfully I chose this one instead of a harder challenge.
